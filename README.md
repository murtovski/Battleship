# Classic Battleship

I have created my take on the classic Battleship game to be played on Command Line. I took the original size of an 8x8 game and reproduced it
to be played easily. The ships themselves are all a 1x1 where they will be sank after one direct hit.

Users will play against the computer, and will need to sink all 5 enemy battleships to win the game!

## How to play

Battleship is based on the original board game that most people will be familiar with.

### In this version of the game, a user and computer board are generated with five ships for both boards.

- The player's ships are visible to the player, but the computer's ships are concealed to the user.
- The player's ships are displayed to the player using the "X", and will be randomly positioned around the board.
- If the player or computer misses a shot, it will be displayed on the opponents side with a "-".
- If the player or computer sink an enemy ship, it will be displayed using a "@".
- The score will be displayed on every turn and once a player reaches a score of 5 then the enemy can no longer battle!
